# Gem-Jumper
The final project for the very first programming-related course I took in college.

This is a simple, side-scrolling, Mario-type game where the character is controlled by the left and right arrow keys and the space bar is used to jump.

## Controls
- Click menu buttons to navigate between screens.
- Left/Right arrow keys move the player left and right.
- Space bar is jump.
- Jump/walk into gems to collect them.
- Jump on enemies' heads to kill them.

## Notes
- Processing's Minim library is required to run this.
  - To install: Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library -> search for Minim -> install Minim by Damien Di Fede and Anderson Mills
- This game was made when screen resolutions were a lot worse than they are now. Launching this game on a high resolution screen will cause the game window to be tiny, and in order to fix this issue many of the current calculations for where sprites and text are drawn on the screen would need to be re-worked.
