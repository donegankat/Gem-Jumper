# Gem-Jumper
The final project for the very first programming-related course I took in college.

This is a simple, side-scrolling, Mario-type game where the character is controlled by the left and right arrow keys and the space bar is used to jump.

## Controls
- Click menu buttons to navigate between screens.
- Left/Right arrow keys move the player left and right.
- Space bar is jump.
- Jump/walk into gems to collect them.
- Jump on enemies' heads to kill them.
